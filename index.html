    <h1>Cities</h1>
    <h3>Cities I've lived in:</h3>
    <p>The following cities (listed in alphabetic order) are cities
        that I have lived in.  I was born in Daytona Beach and grew
         up in Cape Canaveral.  I was stationed in Montgomery.  
         I currently live in Satellite Beach.
    </p>

        <span class="home">When my parents divorced, my mom moved
            to Cape Canaveral and worked at Kennedy Space Center.
            This was my home on the weekends and during school vacations.

    <h3>Cities I want to Visit:</h3>
    <p>Greece and Egypt are very rich with history.  I have been
        to Greece and love travelling and vacationing there.  I
        have never been to Egypt and really want to explore the 
        ancient pyramids.  Spain is also very beautiful and has a very 
        rich, colorful culture.
